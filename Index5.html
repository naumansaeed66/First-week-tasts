    <h1>Gaddafi Cricket Stadium</h1>
    <p>The stadium was built in 1959 and was designed by architect and civil engineer Nasreddin Murat-Khan and construction was completed by Mian Abdul Khaliq and Company. It was originally established as the Lahore Stadium.
        On 19 March 1972, the stadium was renamed in honour of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi by the then president of Pakistan, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto while addressing a public meeting in Lahore.[12][13] On 23 October 2011, the Pakistan Cricket Board discussed renaming the stadium following the death of Gaddafi, to support the new government in Libya. The Punjab Olympic Association made a similar request in late October 2011 to the provincial chief minister. Association secretary Idrees Haider Khawaja said, "I don't think his profile is inspirational enough to link with our cricket stadium's identity."[11] However, the stadium's name was not changed
